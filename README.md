# DuplicateFinder

Duplicates Finder

Simple application which can help you find duplicate files from two chosen directories.
Duplicates have the same name, size and content. The application is not finished yet. It's need parallelization and design optimization but for now it can work totally fine with a small amount of files

Instruction

Just enter the directories you want to scan (use file system widgets) then press the "check" button. 
Do not select directories with a large number of files and directories in it (more than 100 000) cause program is not optimized yet and it'll take much time untill the algorithm finishes it's job
