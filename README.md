# DuplicateFinder

DuplicateFinder is a simple application allows you to find copies of files on your computer. You can scan two folders (with inside directories or without them) to find out if there are duplicates in them.
After main algorithm finishes it work you can scroll the list and open each duplicate in the explorer if you want to. Look doc file for more information.

List of possible improvments:
1) New algorithm that uses affordable amount of cores and also much easier for stopping (or find out how you can deal with terminate method)
2) Table with columns (Name/size/path) instead of just simple sorted widget list for results
3) items should be sended portionally, not one by one
4) Reveal file at the explorer after doubleclick on the item. Not just open the folder
5) Port on unix
